# Bridging the Domain Gap: Synthetic-to-Real Image Classification with Domain Adaptation

This repository contains a complete pipeline for training an image classifier on synthetic images and adapting it for real-world performance using advanced domain adaptation techniques.

The project explores how synthetic datasetsâ€”generated using prompt-based diffusion modelsâ€”can be leveraged to train robust classifiers, with further enhancements through Conditional Domain Adversarial Networks (CDAN), pseudo-labeling, spectral normalization, and consistency regularization.
